## 1. Settings
This project use Thymeleaf, spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter Library.
SpringBoot can easily make project at 'https://start.spring.io/'.
Today's tendency is make project at start.spring.io and use Tomcat Library.
Using Tomcat Library is for easy to setting server.
Just write code and start server is done.
If you want to distribute Server, just build project __snapshot.jar and execute the jar file "java -jar __snapshot.jar" at the target PC(Server PC).
And want quit server just exit the .jar PID.
